### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - As I said above, Kevin's videos have been extremely helpful. They're informative, interesting, and well-produced. I inted to keep devouring them and recommend them to anyone in this same web dev journey.
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This is where I get all of my markdown information from. There is good info there and a nice cheat sheet, as well.
- [PX converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - I use this resource a LOT trying not to use px anymore than I have to. I've learned/been told that rem is the best unit, overall, so I try to stick to that as much as possible.
- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) - free resource to view markdown files
- [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) - wonderful free image placeholder service
